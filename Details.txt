  JWT:
    JSON Web Token, used to encrypt a certain data ( string, object, array )

  JWT is going to provided a end-to-end security for You application

  Custom Middleware:
    we mannually intercept the request that is incoming at server level

    then, We will do some logic
  
  Authentication & Authorization:

    Authentication:
      application user -> login (Store the JWT for Authorization )
      not an application user -> Register & Login (Store the JWT for Authorization )
    
    Authorization:  
      specific rules for specific apis
        /teachers --> can only be viewed by Teachers ( JWT for Teahcer user )
        /students --> Students & Teachers ( JWT for Student/Teacher user )
        /todos --> any authenticated( JWT for normal user ) user can view it
  

Next Session:
  Registration Verify Email:

    BE:

      When user is registered,
        put an extra field called as isVerified: false

        send an email with url as the following,
          <FE-URL>/verify-user-fe?token=<jwt-token>

      /verify-user ( POST Call )
        body: 
          jwt token which contains userinfo ( token will expire in 15mins )
        
        gets the token verifies the token, get the useringo and make user's isVerified field as true
    
    FE:

      /verify-user-fe

        this page will read the token query parameter ( use hook useSearchParams from react-router-dom ) 
        then will trigger an api call to /verify-user ( query parameter or POST body)

    created a simple ui in frontend for the mail url

    created a simple api to Verify the jwt and set verified flag to true

    Password Reset Flow:
      1. Forgot Password Page
          1. Should have a input to take email
          2. Trigger an API POST call /forgot-password with email ( query param / body )
          3. Success -> UI should say Email for reseting sent successfully
          4. Failure -> Please check the email and try again
      
      2. BE API /forgot-password

          1. Get email using query param / body
          2. Check if the user exists
              Yes, send an email <FE-URL>/reset-password?token=<jwt-token>
                Response with { msg: 'Password Reset Email Sent successfully', code: 1 }
              No, send a response status 404 ( user not found ), code: -1
      
      3.0. /verify-token 
          simply accepts a token
          token valid send success response with email address
          invalid send error response
      
      3. Reset Password Page:
          1. /reset-password?token=<jwt-token>
          2. verify the token using /verify-token ( pass the received )
              Yes, Open the Form with new password
                Get the password
                Submit --> trigger email for reset the password /reset-Password
                body: email, new password
                backend hash the password and store it with the proper email
              No, link expired please try again
      
      4. BE API /reset-password ( Body: email, new password) 
                body: email, new password
                backend hash the password and store it with the proper email

    URL Shortener:

      Login: Refer the node-project & react-fe-with-be
      Register: Refer the node-project & react-fe-with-be

      Step 1:
        UI should a have a form for entering the long url

          1. Enter URL and click submit
          2. Trigger an api to the backend /url-shortner
              pass (longUrl in the body or params)
          
      Step 2:
        backend will receive the longUrl 
        longUrl should be mapped with a short url ( <FE-URL>/<url-id> )

        DB should contain:
          longUrl
          urlId
          shortUrl: <FE-URL>/<url-id>
        
        send the response back like below
          {
            msg: "Url shortened successfully",
            shortUrl: <FE-URL>/<url-id>
          }
      
      Step 3:
        Says somebody visits the shorturl,

          <fe-url>/<url-id>

          get the url-id using useParams
          trigger an api call to get the long-url
          {
            long-url: actual-long-url
          } 
          redirect to the long-url from our Front-End
          location.replace(longUrl); will redirect to the long-url


Task:

  Implement the complete FE & BE discussed in the session.

  ** Do not copy paste, please try to write it on Your own by understanding it clearly  **
  
  Create a new repo register-login,

    1. Register Page & related API in backend
    2. Login & Realted API in backend
    3. Login response should send a JWT token to FE
    4. FE will use that token to further making apis calls /teachers & /students
    5. Create pages for Students & /teachers & related APIs in the backend
    6. Send a sample email after registration( saving user in DB )
